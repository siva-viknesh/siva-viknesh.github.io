permalink: /publication/conf_paper2
excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">This work examines the impact of wind flow patterns on wildfire propagation by revisiting the Asensio wildfire model and introducing a non-dimensionalization that considers three distinct time scales, resulting in two non-dimensional numbers. A scaling analysis is conducted to analyze wildfire behavior under these numbers. A wildfire transport solver is developed using a finite difference method with compact spatial schemes and an implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta integrator. The study investigates transient wildfire behavior under steady wind velocity, focusing on saddle-type fixed points and the role of the non-dimensional numbers. It also explores unsteady wind conditions through double gyre flow, analyzing different oscillation frequencies and amplitudes. The findings underscore the complex interactions between wildfire dynamics and wind patterns, enhancing understanding of wind-driven wildfire behavior.</p>'
