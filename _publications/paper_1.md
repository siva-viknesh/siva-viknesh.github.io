excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">This study investigates grid sensitivity in the bifurcation problem of lid-driven cavity (LDC) flow using very fine grids. Researchers have reported different critical Reynolds numbers (Recr1) for the first bifurcation, influenced by formulation, numerical methods, and grid selection. Using a highly accurate parallel algorithm, results were obtained on fine grids (1025×1025 and 2049×2049), providing insights into the computational physics of LDC flow. The findings highlight the interchangeable roles of numerical errors and real-flow disturbances, stressing the need for explicit excitation in compact schemes. These results offer universal benchmarks for solving the Navier-Stokes equation for LDC with near-spectral accuracy.</p>'
