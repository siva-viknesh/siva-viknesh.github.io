excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">This investigation addresses grid sensitivity for the bifurcation problem of the canonical lid-driven cavity (LDC) flow using very fine grids. Different researchers present varying first bifurcation critical Reynolds numbers (Recr1), which depend on formulation, numerical method, and grid choice. Utilizing a very-high-accuracy parallel algorithm, results are obtained using (1025×1025) and (2049×2049) grid points, enhancing understanding of the computational physics of numerical receptivity of LDC flow. The mathematical physics become evident as we identify the interchangeable roles of numerical errors and ambient disturbances in real flows, emphasizing the necessity for explicit excitation in the compact scheme. These results, demonstrating near spectral accuracy, establish universal benchmarks for solving the Navier-Stokes equation for LDC.</p>'
