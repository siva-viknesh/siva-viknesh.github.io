excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">Experiments are conducted on the control of massively separated flow over a symmetric airfoil by imposing pitching oscillation at smaller amplitudes. Two symmetric airfoils of different thickness to chord ratios are considered to account for the effect of thickness and stall-type on flow control. Instantaneous aerodynamic forces and moments are calculated by integrating surface and wake pressure distributions. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry and unsteady pressure measurements are carried out simultaneously to characterize the flow field over the pitching airfoil. The results presented here provide insight into flow dynamics and the dynamic response of a stalled airfoil to pitching oscillation at different reduced frequencies. The present research adopts a dynamical system approach and attempts to estimate an optimum pitching oscillation frequency for better flow control on a stalled airfoil. The adopted methodology can be used to determine the optimal value of input parameters pertaining to flow control on a flat plate/wing by any unsteady excitation. Besides, a novel data-driven aerodynamic model has been developed on a Fourier basis for a symmetrical airfoil undergoing pitching oscillation at the post-stall regime.</p>'
