excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">This research investigates the control of massively separated flow over a symmetric airfoil through low-amplitude pitching oscillations. Two airfoils with different thickness-to-chord ratios are analyzed to examine the effects of thickness and stall type on flow control. Aerodynamic forces and moments are computed using surface and wake pressure data, while time-resolved particle image velocimetry and unsteady pressure measurements characterize the flow field. The study provides insights into the dynamic response of a stalled airfoil to varying oscillation frequencies and proposes an optimal pitching frequency for enhanced flow control. Additionally, a data-driven aerodynamic model based on Fourier analysis is developed for airfoils in the post-stall regime.</p>'
