excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">This paper addresses the challenges of identifying nonlinear dynamical systems with nonlinear parameters, which complicates the derivation of mathematical models essential for understanding physical phenomena. Traditional methods like Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression can extract governing equations from observational data, but they have notable limitations. To overcome these, the paper introduces a novel methodology within the SINDy framework called ADAM-SINDy, which integrates the ADAM optimization algorithm. This approach allows for the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients related to nonlinear candidate functions, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of characteristics like trigonometric frequencies and polynomial exponents. ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown variables based on system-specific data, resulting in a more adaptive and efficient identification process that minimizes sensitivity to the candidate function library. The methodology is demonstrated across various dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations and nonlinear partial differential equations, such as those modeling wildfire transport. The results indicate substantial improvements in identifying parameterized dynamical systems and emphasize the importance of concurrent optimization of all parameters, particularly nonlinear ones. This highlights the potential of ADAM-SINDy to enhance the SINDy framework's applicability in addressing complex challenges in dynamical system identification.</p>'
