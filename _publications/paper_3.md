excerpt: >
  <p style="text-align: justify;">This paper tackles the challenges of identifying nonlinear dynamical systems with nonlinear parameters, which complicates the derivation of essential mathematical models. Traditional methods like Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression have notable limitations in extracting governing equations from observational data. To address these, we introduce ADAM-SINDy, a novel methodology within the SINDy framework that incorporates the ADAM optimization algorithm. This approach enables simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and coefficients without prior knowledge of characteristics such as trigonometric frequencies or polynomial exponents. ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts unknown variables based on system-specific data, enhancing the identification process and reducing sensitivity to the candidate function library. Demonstrated across various dynamical systems, including coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations and wildfire transport models, our results show significant improvements in parameter identification. This highlights ADAM-SINDy's potential to extend the SINDy framework's applicability in complex dynamical system identification challenges.</p>
