excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;"> This study investigates wildfire propagation by analyzing the interaction between wind velocity, fuel, and terrain. A revised non-dimensionalization of the combustion model introduces two new non-dimensional numbers, aiding in the prediction of wildfire spread. A state-neutral curve was derived to identify conditions for wildfire extinction. A wildfire transport solver using advanced numerical methods models the influence of wind topology, examining both steady and unsteady wind conditions. The wildfire's response to varying wind oscillation frequencies is assessed, with comparisons to Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS). These findings offer improved insights for wildfire modeling and management strategies.</p>'
