excerpt: 'The investigation on grid sensitivity for the bifurcation problem of the canonical lid-driven cavity (LDC) flow results is reported here with very fine grids. This is motivated by different researchers presenting different first bifurcation critical Reynolds number (Recr1), which depends on the formulation, numerical method, and choice of grid. Using a very-high-accuracy parallel algorithm, we present results using (1025×1025) and (2049×2049) grid points. 

These results help us understand the computational physics of numerical receptivity of the LDC flow, revealing the interchangeable roles of numerical errors and ambient disturbances in real flows. The necessity for explicit excitation for the used compact scheme is highlighted. With near spectral accuracy, these results constitute universal benchmark results for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation for LDC.'
