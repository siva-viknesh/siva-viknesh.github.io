excerpt: 'The investigation on grid sensitivity for the bifurcation problem of the canonical lid-driven cavity (LDC) flow results is reported here with very fine grids. This is motivated by different researchers presenting different first bifurcation critical Reynolds number (Recr1), which appears to depend on the formulation, numerical method, and choice of grid. Using a very-high-accuracy parallel algorithm, we present results using (1025×1025) and (2049×2049) grid points, helping us understand the computational physics of numerical receptivity of the LDC flow. The mathematical physics will become apparent when we identify the roles of numerical errors with ambient disturbances in real flows as interchangeable, highlighting the necessity for explicit excitation for the used compact scheme. These results, with near spectral accuracy, constitute universal benchmark results for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation for LDC.'
