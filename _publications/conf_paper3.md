excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">We introduce a novel methodology within the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems (SINDy) framework, called SGD-SINDy, which utilizes stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization to improve parameter identification while reducing reliance on predefined candidate libraries. Unlike traditional SINDy, SGD-SINDy efficiently identifies parameters without prior knowledge of linear distributions or nonlinear characteristics such as frequencies and bandwidths. It also streamlines hyperparameter tuning by optimizing them concurrently during the process. Our approach demonstrates significant effectiveness across various dynamical systems, including harmonic oscillators, Van der Pol oscillators, chaotic ABC flow, and reaction kinetics, showcasing substantial improvements in parameter identification, particularly in nonlinear contexts. This highlights the potential of SGD optimization to advance SINDy-based analyses.</p>'
