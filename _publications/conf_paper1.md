title: "AI-augmented hemodynamics: 3D blood flow field construction from pressure measurements"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/conf_paper1
excerpt: '<p style="text-align: justify;">This paper introduces a deep learning method using physics-informed neural networks (PINN) to create a 3D blood flow velocity field from pressure data measured along the centerline of an artery, specifically using instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) measurements. The approach leverages recent advancements in PINN, including neuron-wise adaptive activation functions, to effectively solve complex 3D flow fields in stenosed arteries. The paper also addresses the causality issues inherent in the PINN framework across spatial domains and proposes a solution to determine unknown inlet and outlet boundary conditions, enabling the calculation of the entire flow field from pressure data. The framework is applied to a patient-specific coronary artery stenosis model, demonstrating its accuracy and the potential to obtain comprehensive blood flow field data from experimental pressure wire measurements.</p>'
