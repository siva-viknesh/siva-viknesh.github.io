<div style="text-align: justify;">
👨🏻‍🎓 <strong>PhD Candidate</strong> in the SCI Institute and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah, working with <strong>Dr. Amirhossein Arzani</strong>.<br><br>

🔬 <strong>Research Interests:</strong> <em>Scientific Machine Learning</em>, <em>Computational Fluid Mechanics</em>, <em>Inverse Problems</em>, <em>Wildfire Dynamics</em>, <em>Hemodynamics</em>, and <em>Unsteady Aerodynamics</em>.<br><br>

🌊 <strong>Fluid Mechanics:</strong> I have a strong inclination towards Unsteady Fluid Mechanics, delving into areas such as cardiovascular flow, wildfire dynamics, and unsteady aerodynamics. I also focus on developing computational methods and integrating Machine Learning methodologies to solve these complex problems.<br><br>

🎓 <strong>Educational Background:</strong> I hold a Master’s degree in Aerospace Engineering, specializing in Aerodynamics, from <strong>IIT Kanpur</strong>, India. I had the privilege of working in the HPCL Lab with <strong>Dr. Tapan K. Sengupta</strong> and the LSA Lab with <strong>Dr. Kamal Poddar</strong>, where I focused on Computational Fluid Mechanics and Wind Tunnel Measurements. My Bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from <strong>Anna University</strong>, Tamil Nadu, India, sparked my passion for Aerodynamics and solving PDEs.<br><br>

## 🔬 Academic Research
- 🔥 **[Wildfire Dynamics](https://github.com/siva-viknesh/Wildland_Fire_Dynamics):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Discovered two new non-dimensional numbers governing convection-diffusion-reaction combustion models for the first time. Scaling analysis predicts future fire propagation without reliance on simulations (paper submitted).
  </div>

- 🤖 **[Interpretable Machine Learning](https://github.com/siva-viknesh/ADAM-SINDy):**
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Developed the <strong>ADAM-SINDy</strong> framework for system identification of non-linear dynamical systems, avoiding prior system knowledge (paper submitted).
  </div>

- 🛩️ **[Pitching Airfoil](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/33/8/087115/1080453/Active-control-of-separated-flow-on-a-symmetric):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Identified upstream-convecting vortices (vortices advecting against the flow direction) on a pitching airfoil using Time-resolved PIV & Pressure measurements.
  </div>

- 🌪️ **[Flow Instabilities](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.013305):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Sensitivity of multiple Hopf bifurcations and critical Reynolds numbers in lid-driven cavity flow problems, noting the influence of numerical methods and grid resolution.
  </div>

## 🖥️ Software and Simulations
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I have developed and optimized several programs/solvers related to scientific machine learning and fluid flow problems. Please note that if the links are unavailable or denied, the corresponding papers are still under review.  </div>
