<div style="text-align: justify;">
    üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the SCI Institute at the University of Utah, under the supervision of Dr. Amirhossein Arzani.<br><br>
    üî¨ My research interests include Scientific Machine Learning, Inverse Problems, Wildfire Dynamics, Hemodynamics, and Unsteady Aerodynamics.<br><br>
    üìö I have a strong focus on fluid flow problems, particularly in Unsteady Aerodynamics, using computational methods, with experience in experimental methods during my MS program.<br><br>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
üìΩÔ∏è I am also passionate about mentoring others in the areas of mechanical engineering and research methodologies.<br><br>

# Selected Experience

## üî¨ Academic Research
- **Wildfire Dynamics:** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Discovered two new non-dimensional numbers governing convection-diffusion-reaction models for the first time. Conducted scaling analysis that predicts future fire propagation without reliance on simulations (paper submitted).
  </div>

- **Interpretable Machine Learning:**
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Developed the **ADAM-SINDy** framework for system identification of non-linear dynamical systems without prior knowledge (paper submitted).
  </div>

- **Flow Control in Aerodynamics:** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Identified upstream-convecting vortices (vortices moving against the flow direction) on a pitching airfoil using time-resolved PIV experiments. [Read the paper here](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/33/8/087115/1080453/Active-control-of-separated-flow-on-a-symmetric)!
  </div>

- **Fluid Dynamics:** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Investigated the sensitivity of multiple Hopf bifurcations and critical Reynolds numbers in lid-driven cavity flow problems, noting the influence of numerical methods and grid resolution. [Read the paper here](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.013305)!
