![Illustration of dynamical system analysis](/images/image_to_text_vis.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah.

🔬 My research interests lie in system identification, dynamical systems, and wildfire simulations. I focus on enhancing models of transient wind-driven wildfire propagation.

📚 Currently, my work involves the SGraD-SINDy method for identifying sparse dynamics in high-dimensional systems.

📽️ I am also passionate about guiding others through the intricacies of mechanical engineering and research methodologies.

# Selected Experience

## 🔬 Academic Research Contributions
I am investigating wildfire propagation under varying wind topologies, aiming to better understand the interaction between fire fronts and complex wind dynamics. This includes developing methodologies like the **SGraD-SINDy** framework for improved system identification.

## 🖥️ Software and Simulations
I have experience in developing and optimizing simulation environments, particularly in wildfire modeling, including contributions to the analysis of time-varying wind effects on fire behavior.

## 👨🏻‍🏫 Teaching and Community Contributions
As a teaching assistant at the University of Utah, I have been responsible for guiding students through fundamental and advanced topics in mechanical engineering and system dynamics.
