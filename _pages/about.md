<div style="text-align: justify;">
👨🏻‍💻 I am currently pursuing a PhD in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the SCI Institute at the University of Utah, working with of Dr. Amirhossein Arzani.<br><br>
🔬 My research interests revolve around Scientific Machine Learning, Inverse Problems, Wildfire Dynamics, Hemodynamics, and Unsteady Aerodynamics.<br><br>
📚 I have a strong focus on fluid flow problems, particularly in Unsteady Aerodynamics, using computational methods, with experience in experimental methods during my MS program.<br><br>
</div>

📽️ I am also passionate about mentoring others in the areas of mechanical engineering and research methodologies.<br><br>

# Selected Experience

## 🔬 Academic Research
- **[Wildfire Dynamics](https://github.com/siva-viknesh/Wildland_Fire_Dynamics):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Discovered two new non-dimensional numbers governing convection-diffusion-reaction combustion models for the first time. Scaling analysis predicts future fire propagation without reliance on simulations (paper submitted).
  </div>

- **[Interpretable Machine Learning](https://github.com/siva-viknesh/ADAM-SINDy):**
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Developed the **ADAM-SINDy** framework for system identification of non-linear dynamical systems, avoiding prior system knowledge (paper submitted).
  </div>

- **[Pitching Airfoil](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/33/8/087115/1080453/Active-control-of-separated-flow-on-a-symmetric):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Identified upstream-convecting vortices (vortices advecting against the flow direction) on a pitching airfoil using Time-resolved PIV experiments.
  </div>

- **[Flow Instabilites](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.013305):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Sensitivity of multiple Hopf bifurcations and critical Reynolds numbers in lid-driven cavity flow problems, noting the influence of numerical methods and grid resolution.
  </div>
