<div style="text-align: justify;">
üë®üèª‚Äçüéì <strong>PhD Candidate</strong> in the Scientific Computing & Imaging (SCI) Institute and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Utah, advised by <strong>Dr. Amirhossein Arzani</strong>.<br><br>

üî¨ <strong>Research Interests:</strong> <em>Scientific Machine Learning</em>, <em>Computational Fluid Mechanics</em>, <em>Inverse Problems</em>, <em>Wildfire Dynamics</em>, <em>Hemodynamics</em>, and <em>Unsteady Aerodynamics</em>.<br><br>

üåä <strong>Fluid Mechanics:</strong> I am strongly inclined towards Fluid Mechanics, delving into areas such as cardiovascular flow, wildfire dynamics, and unsteady aerodynamics. I also focus on developing computational methods and integrating machine learning methodologies to solve these complex problems.<br><br>

üéì <strong>Educational Background:</strong> I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Aerospace Engineering, specializing in Aerodynamics, from <strong>IIT Kanpur</strong>, India. I had the privilege of working in the HPCL Lab with <strong>Dr. Tapan K. Sengupta</strong> and the LSA Lab with <strong>Dr. Kamal Poddar</strong>, where I focused on both Computational Fluid Mechanics and Wind Tunnel Measurements. My Bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering from <strong>Anna University</strong>, Tamil Nadu, India, sparked my passion for Aerodynamics and solving PDEs.<br><br>

## üî¨ Academic Research
- üî• **[Wildfire Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04007v1):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Discovered two new non-dimensional numbers governing convection-diffusion-reaction combustion models for the first time. Scaling analysis predicts future fire propagation without reliance on simulations (paper submitted).

- ü§ñ **[Interpretable Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16528):**
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Developed the <strong>ADAM-SINDy</strong> framework for system identification of non-linear dynamical systems, avoiding prior system knowledge (paper submitted). Check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/4vTV2xLCOGQ" target="_blank"><strong>CRUNCH Seminar Talk</strong></a>.

- üõ©Ô∏è **[Pitching Airfoil](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/33/8/087115/1080453/Active-control-of-separated-flow-on-a-symmetric):** 
  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Identified upstream-convecting vortices (vortices advecting against the flow direction) on a pitching airfoil using Time-resolved PIV & Pressure measurements.
  </div>

- üå™Ô∏è **[Flow Instabilities](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.013305):**
